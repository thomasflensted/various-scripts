### Various scripts

This is where I keep various small scripts I have created over time.

* delete_wp_products: Deletes files from a wordpress site.
* image-resize: Batch resizes images to a specified size. Ignore image smaller than specified size.
* srt-formatter: Adds dashes, capitalizes letters, adds periods and more to SRT-files (srt is a subtitle format)
